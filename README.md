# EURO-2024 Dispatcher Bot

## Project Description

This UiPath process automates the initial handling of Euro 2024 player data files created by the [EURO 2024](https://github.com/yehiarasheed/EURO-2024) repository. Each file is named after a country and contains a sheet with player details for that country's Euro 2024 team, including player name, team, age, weight, and height.

### Dispatcher Bot Overview

The dispatcher bot takes user input for three country names, validates the existence of corresponding files, logs any invalid entries, and adds valid country names and file paths to a queue. This process sets the stage for the performer bot, which processes these entries efficiently.

### Performer Bot Overview

The performer bot, which runs unattended and is triggered by the queue populated by the dispatcher bot, is located in the [EURO 2024 Performer](https://github.com/yehiarasheed/EURO-2024-Performer) repository.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> All file paths used in the project are relative paths, so any user can clone the project and use it right out of the box. In the `Additional Files` folder, you will find the Excel workbooks containing all the player and team data by country name inside the `Inputs` folder.
